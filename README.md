# Cube-Traversal
Consider paths from point A to point B. 
If we put a counter on every edge of a cube that counts the number of `forwards - backwards` traversals of the edge, we will get a set of "composite pathway classes".
The goal of this project is to test if, using less counters than that, we can still find which composite pathway class a given pathway lies in.
One example is a 2D cube considering paths from the bottom left to top left corner: only one counter on one edge is sufficient to determine all composite pathways.
